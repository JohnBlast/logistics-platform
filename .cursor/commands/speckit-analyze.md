# Spec-Kit: Analyze

Run a Spec-Kit analysis of the logistics platform: spec-implementation alignment, gaps, TBDs, and readiness.

## Objective

Produce a structured analysis report covering:
1. Platform overview (001, 002, 003 status)
2. Spec–implementation alignment per feature
3. Remaining TBDs from PRDs and plans
4. Checklist gaps (requirements-checklist §F observability, etc.)
5. Document hierarchy coherence
6. Prioritized recommendations
7. Verdict: readiness for changes per product

## Requirements

- Reference `.specify/requirements-checklist.md` for completeness items
- Reference `.specify/PLATFORM.md` and `PRD.md` for golden sources
- Reference `AGENTS.md` for document hierarchy
- Identify boundary/decision logging gaps (add if missing)
- Suggest concrete next actions (High/Medium/Low priority)
